### Clone the repo and install requirements
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Create an .env file in the directory & put in your free Gemini API key

    GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
  ### Run the app
  

    streamlit run app.py

PS: Used reportlab, since it was the only library that worked with the WayLand Protocol
